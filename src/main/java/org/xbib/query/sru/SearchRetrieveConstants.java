     * SRU 1.1 only
     * 
     * SRU can be used to retrieve any sort of XML records, regardless of 
     * size or complexity. Records in schemas such as TEI, EAD, SVG, X3D or 
     * OpenOffice's schema can be extremely long and complex.
     * 
     * Clients may request very specific sections of a record, rather than 
     * the entire record, for example to create a title list display. 
     * Even simple Dublin Core records may be considerably longer than 
     * the client requires, and to request the entire thing just to throw
     * most of it away seems wasteful of resources. A client may want to 
     * be able to page through a single record which is too long to 
     * display easily, but lacks the capability to do this segmentation 
     * itself. Another usage scenario would be if the client has some 
     * prior knowledge of the records and is only interested in certain 
     * sections, for example the trumpet section of an XML encoded 
     * musical score.
     * 
     * In order to enable clients to request only the parts of the record 
     * that it is immediately interested in, it may supply an XPath 
     * expression to be evaluated.
     * 
     * Semantics
     * 
     * The recordXPath field in the searchRetrieveRequest contains an 
     * XPath expression to be evaluated for each matching record. 
     * The results of this evaluation should be encoded using the 
     * schema described below.
     * 
     * The xpath expression is considered, unless otherwise namespaced, 
     * to be relative to the record schema. For example, if simple 
     * Dublin Core is given as the record schema, then the path 
     * '/dc/title/' is valid, but '/ead/eadheader/titlestmt/titleproper' 
     * is not, even if the record could be returned in EAD.
     * 
     * The '|' character may be used to separate multiple paths, as 
     * used in XSLT patterns. Equally, the xpath expression may match 
     * multiple nodes within the record. In either scenario, the response 
     * may contain multiple nodes within the nodeSet element in the 
     * response schema.
     * 
     * If the path supplied cannot be evaluated because it is invalid 
     * then the server may respond with a single fatal diagnostic. 
     * On the other hand, if the expression is valid but cannot be 
     * evaluated for a particular record, the server should respond 
     * with a surrogate diagnostic in the correct place within the 
     * result set. If the expression matches no nodes within the record, 
     * then an empty nodeSet may be returned rather than a diagnostic.
     * 
     * Servers may, at their discretion, refuse to process XPaths with 
     * any particular feature. For example, servers may refuse to 
     * process any XPath function, but accept regular paths of elements. 
     * Clients should be prepared for such a refusal via a diagnostic. 
     * Servers may also provide additional XPath functions which are not 
     * part of the standard library, for example a function which 
     * returns the element which matched the search query.
     * 
     * XPath Result Schema
     *

     * ATOM format, the value of the parameter is ‘application/atom+xml’.
     *
     * The default value for the response type is ‘application/sru+xml’.
     * The intent of the httpAccept parameter can be accomplished with
     * an HTTP Accept header. Servers SHOULD support either mechanism.
     * In either case (via the httpAccept parameter or HTTP Accept
     * header), if the server does not support the requested media type t
     * hen the server MUST respond with a 406 status code and SHOULD
     * return an HTML message with pointers to that resource in
     * supported media types.
     * If an SRU server supports multiple media types and uses content
     * negotiation to determine the media type of the response, then
     * the server SHOULD provide a URL in the Content-Location header
     * of the response pointing directly to the response in that mime-type.
     * For instance, if the client had sent the URL
     *    http://example.org/sru?query=dog
     * with an Accept header of  ‘application/rss+xml’,
     * then the server SHOULD return a Content-Location value of
     * http://example.org/sru?query=dog&httpAccept=application/rss+xml.
     * This Content-Location header is returned along with the content
     * itself, presumably in the application/rss+xml format. (It would
     * also be acceptable to return a redirect to that URL instead, but
     * that behavior is not encouraged as it is inefficient.)
     * The default response type is application/sru+xml.  That is, if
     * there is neither an Accept header (or if there is an Accept header
     * of “*”) nor an httpAccept parameter, the response should be of
     * media type application/sru+xml, and a corresponding Content-Location
     * header should be returned with the response. For example if the request is
     *   http://example.org/sru?query=dog
     * a Content-Location header of
